# Alers Package 
This Repository is a Package for the FrikyBot.

The Alerts Package is a classic Overlay based Alert System for Twitch Chat and API Events. Also providing an Alert History and a deeply customizeable Profile System - it might be the most advanced Alerts System ever (well maybe not entirely yet ;P)

Note: This is Code cant be run on its own, its still tied to the FrikyBot Interface and Ecosystem!

## Getting Started
This Package is powered by Node.js and some NPM Modules.

All dependancies are:
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - providing File and API Routing Capabilities

Installing a Package is very easy! Clone this Package to your local machine, wrap it in Folder Named "Alerts" and drop that into your FrikyBot Packages Folder.
Now use the FrikyBot WebInterface and add the Package on the Settings->Packages Page.

## Features

### Alert Overlays
Overlays display Sub, Follow, ... - Alerts, Poll, Predictions, HypeTrain, ... - Events, Sub Counters, ... and more. Different Overlays can be individually styled and have different settings.
Regular Sub, Follow, ... - Alerts use `Alert Profiles` switch can be shared between Overlays or even Alert-Topics, but yet be triggered differently.

### Alert Profiles
Alert Profiles are customizeable Alert designs that provide many common but also many unique options to make your Alerts your own!

### Alert History

HypeTrains and Goals can come and go very fast - having these Events tracked provides streamers an overview of them.
